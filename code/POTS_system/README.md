## **P**ortable **O**rganic **T**rouble-free **S**elf-watering System (**POTS**) Model

The Pots system simulates the (rather short =) ) lifecycle of some vegetables in a container.

In the beginning, several vegetables of different types (classes) are being generated (bokchoy, eggplant, pepper, and stringbean). Furthermore a container is initialized with some soil and water reserves and the plants are planted in it. Over the duration of the simulation, the plants will then consume the reserves available until there is nothing left and they die.
